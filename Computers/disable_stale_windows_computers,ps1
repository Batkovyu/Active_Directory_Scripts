.DESCRIPTION
    This script will disable computer objects that have pwdlastset greater than daysinactive
    and lastlogontimestamp greater than daysinactive
    and not a clustert object
    and is enabled
    and not a critical system object like a domain controller
    and is a windows machine.

    !!!! Remove -whatif after the disable-adaccount cmdlet for to actually disable the account !!!!!!!

.EXAMPLE
    .\disable_stale_windows_computers.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    .\disable_stale_windows_computers.ps1 -DaysInactive 180 -domain "contoso.com" -logpath "c:\temp"


#> 
Param($DaysInactive=90,
    $domain="$((get-addomain).dnsroot)",
    $logpath = $(Split-Path -parent $PSCommandPath))

$log = "$path\$(($domain.Split("."))[0])_disable_stale_windows_computers.log"

#this takes the daysinactive and subtracts it from today's date. 
#Then converts in format used by pwdlastset and lastlogontimestamp
$utc_stale_date = ([DateTime]::Today.AddDays(-$DaysInactive)).ToFileTimeUTC()
